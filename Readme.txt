## The Product
*Truffle init webpack* gave us a headstart.
It is a webpack project which includes contracts, migrations, tests, and user interface to create an application based on Ethereum Blockchain.

## Future Scope / ToDo
We did miss implementing some features beacuse of lack of available time, but we aim to get it completed as soon as possible. 
Improving the interface is certainly one of the priorities. The branch `ab-1` hosts the latest UI.
