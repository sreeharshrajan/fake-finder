# Fake Finder – The Legit News Finding dApp

## Overview
**Fake Finder** is a decentralized prediction market for news articles, built on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses crowdsourcing and a reputation system to collectively evaluate the authenticity and credibility of news content.

## The Team
- Sreeharsh K  
- Arjun KV  
- Sriprabha S

## The Product
This project was bootstrapped using `truffle init webpack`, which provided a starting point with:
- Smart contracts
- Migration scripts
- Test framework
- Frontend UI powered by Webpack

The goal is to create a fully decentralized application (dApp) that promotes truth in journalism via community consensus.

## Future Scope / ToDo
Although we’ve built a working prototype, some features were left out due to time constraints. We plan to:
- Improve the user interface (see the `ab-1` branch for the latest version)
- Enhance the prediction and reputation logic
- Expand wallet support and smart contract interactions
